# ⏳ Time Series Analysis of Air Quality (NO₂)

This project applies advanced time series analysis techniques to air quality data, specifically focusing on NO₂ concentration levels collected over multiple years. The objective is to explore patterns, detect seasonality, and forecast future pollution levels using statistical models like ARIMA and machine learning-based approaches like Facebook Prophet.

## 📌 Key Features
- Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals)
- Rolling statistics for stationarity checks
- Variance stabilization using log, square root, and Box-Cox transformations
- Forecasting using ARIMA and Prophet models
- Anomaly detection using Z-score and IQR methods
- Visualizations of year-wise trends and monthly patterns

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes timestamped NO₂ concentration values obtained from open government air quality sources (or user-provided).

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
- Facebook Prophet
- SciPy for statistical testing

## 🎯 Outcomes
- Identified strong seasonal trends and non-constant variance in NO₂ levels
- Achieved variance stabilization through transformations
- Forecasted future NO₂ trends with validated performance metrics
- Insights can support environmental policy-making and pollution monitoring
